könnte“ von Jan Claas van Treeck, PhD Humboldt Universität, Berlin</p><p>„Mensch und Menschlichkeit sind seit langem privilegierte Konzepte unserer (Selbst-)Wahrnehmung. Wir Menschen sind angeblich anders und besser als Dinge, Pflanzen, Tiere, weswegen Menschen zum einen besonderen Schutz und Rechte genießen, zum anderen aber angeblich auch spezielle Verantwortungen tragen (sollen). Ist der Mensch etwa die „Krone der Schöpfung“, dann muss es gelten Kranke und Behinderte wieder auf ein menschliches „Normalmaß“ zu heilen oder aufzurüsten. Abweichung vom Normalmaß „Mensch“ sind nach unten (Behinderung) oder oben (übermenschliche Leistungssteigerung/Cyborgisierung) nach einer solchen gesellschaftlich dominanten normativen „Menschensicht“ abzulehnen.</p><p>Neben diesem normativen Zugriff auf den Menschen gibt es allerdings einen zweiten geistesgeschichtlichen Strang, der versucht den Menschen nicht aus seiner Privilegierung sondern aus seiner „Defizienz“ heraus zu definieren. Technik und die Auf- und Umrustüng des Menschen sind in dieser Sicht quasi „natürlich“ und machen den „Menschen“ erst zum „Menschen“. Wie könnte eine solche Cyborggeschichtsschreibung aussehen und welche Konsequenzen könnte sie haben?“</p><p>The talk is held in German language.</p>","title":"Plug'n'Play Meeting #6 with talk „Warum wir schon immer Cyborgs waren und was das für Konsequenzen haben könnte“","status":"published","cover":[{"id":"cyborgs.png","location":"v2","item":{"id":"cyborgs.png","url":"/Users/gilbert/Code/lacuna-media/v2/cyborgs.png","name":"cyborgs","ext":"png","width":481,"height":216,"ratio":0.4490644490644491,"location":{"path":"/Users/gilbert/Code/lacuna-media/v2","name":"v2"},"meta":{"megapixels":0.104,"colours":["hsl(26,44.2%,50.0%)","hsl(26,44.2%,25.3%)","hsl(199,36.7%,88.2%)","hsl(100,12.5%,47.1%)","hsl(28,23.5%,26.7%)","hsl(176,9.5%,71.0%)"]},"size":175343,"mime":"image/png","unique":"8639432640-1594077346000-1623591850697.1968","api":"/api/lacuna/media/v2/cyborgs.png.json","created":1594077346,"updated":1594077346}}],"meta":"„Warum wir schon immer Cyborgs waren und was das für Konsequenzen haben könnte“","tags":[{"id":"meetup","model":"tags","item":{"id":"meetup","created":1623687546,"updated":1623687546}},{"id":"talk","model":"tags","item":{"id":"talk","created":1623688843,"updated":1623688843}}],"links":[{"id":"jan-claasvan-treeck","model":"links","item":{"url":"https://hu-berlin.academia.edu/JanClaasvanTreeck","title":"Jan Claasvan Treeck","id":"jan-claasvan-treeck","created":1623850471,"updated":1623850471}},{"id":"plug-play-006","model":"links","item":{"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1648939895360747/","title":"Facebook event","id":"plug-play-006","created":1623850434,"updated":1623850434}}],"updated":1623851088,"associated":[{"id":"cyborgs","model":"profiles","item":{"name":"Cyborgs e.V.","biography":null,"email":"hello@cyborgs.cc","picture":[{"id":"logocyborgsev-236x300.png","location":"v2","item":{"id":"logocyborgsev-236x300.png","url":"/Users/gilbert/Code/lacuna-media/v2/logocyborgsev-236x300.png","name":"logocyborgsev-236x300","ext":"png","width":236,"height":300,"ratio":1.271186440677966,"location":{"path":"/Users/gilbert/Code/lacuna-media/v2","name":"v2"},"meta":{"megapixels":0.071,"colours":["hsl(0,0.0%,50.0%)","hsl(0,0.0%,26.0%)","hsl(0,0.0%,74.0%)","hsl(0,0.0%,30.0%)","hsl(0,0.0%,1.6%)","hsl(0,0.0%,30.0%)"]},"size":5709,"mime":"image/png","unique":"8639432649-1594083458000-1623591850725.6707","api":"/api/lacuna/media/v2/logocyborgsev-236x300.png.json","created":1594083458,"updated":1594083458}}],"links":[{"id":"cyborgs-ev-website","model":"links","item":{"title":"Website","url":"cyborgs.cc","id":"cyborgs-ev-website"}}],"id":"cyborgs","type":"community","updated":1623837694,"picture-style":"light","associated":[]}}],"extra":[]},{"start":1439834400,"end":null,"id":"plugnplay-meeting-5","places":[{"id":"lacuna-lab","model":"places","item":{"address":"Paul-Lincke-Ufer 44A, 10999 Berlin\n","title":"Lacuna Lab","id":"lacuna-lab","created":1623700707,"updated":1623700707}}],"description":"<p>It's summer, it's hot, we desperately need to cool down.

public to build a collective memory.</p><p>Fara Peluso’s works are placed at the interconnection between art, design and science, showing how a new way to design is already today possible through a speculative methodology.</p><p>A design made just for the human being perspective is replaced with a new practice which considers all living organisms too.

But also to see them go. The things that remain, the arches and ornaments, tell us of a life that has been lived. Single shards spell out eternity. Jars and vessels are libraries and witnesses all at once: the outlines of eternal travelers who never arrive, but shouldn’t be impeded. Decisions should only be made when one is aware of various possibilities. Retreat into one’s own existence. Dilute one’s identity. ‘I’ is only a construction, too. Swim. Be water my friend. So limpid as to provide a large area for the phantoms and projections of others. Transparent bodies. A heart of glass. Back in the days, people never got old enough to get cancer. Procedures. The representation of death as sickness. The metaphysical order of things. An understanding that living beings in the world are compositions standing side by side, tightly bound enough to make it through the day, and that in spite of everything they are of this earth, in life and death. And this way of being an ‘earthling’ is a kind of counterpoint to the transcendentalism of philosophy, science and politics, as well as all the other, different regimes that involve a commitment to deathlessness. The spider weaves the world.</em></p><p>In our project “Spaced Out in Outer Space” we will examine the history of the balance in cybernetics and biology and its influence on our contemporary conception of nature and society. We are interested in the question of the extent to which notions of “pure” nature, immortality and space travel have always been a fantasy in western science and art to escape a faulty existence and to change it instead of accepting its limits.&nbsp;</p><p>For this purpose, Paul Wiersbinski will create stories and shoot videos to examine narration itself as a political tool and to talk about what future communities might look like. Based on these narratives, Behrang Karimi will produce drawings and paintings.&nbsp;Our goal is to tell a story that is big enough and yet open to talk about current doomsday fantasies.

For the collective’s inaugural exhibition, spores of ideas waft across the canal from their studio on Paul-Lincke-Ufer, taking root as a multi-channel network of biology- and technology-based pieces. These objects and installations draw input from their surroundings in Spektrum, the audience, and one another, creating a playful environment of screens, textiles, lights, lasers, plants, water vapor, and interwoven generative sounds. Opening with a live-generated audio-visual-dance performance, this exhibition investigates collaboration, perception, growth and decay.</p><p><strong>Program</strong></p><p>Friday 22 April: 18:00 OPENING of the exhibition</p><p>Saturday 23 &amp; Sunday 24 April: Exhibition open from 17:00</p><p>Performances at 19:30 and 21:00 on Friday and Saturday</p><p><strong>Participants</strong></p><p>Abe Pazos, Assi Pakkanen, Aurelia Friedland, Claudine Chen, Jemma Woolmore, Jeremias Volker, Joa Ritter, Marcel Schwittlick, Mei-Fang Liau, Peter Kolski, Ramin Soleymani, Sarah Hermanutz, Sé Sneaky, Soma Holiday, Takuro Iwata, Thomas Heidtmann, Yoko Iki</p><p><strong>PROJECTS</strong></p><p>GREENHOUSE</p><p>The Greenhouse is an immersive sensory environment, a temporary passage between rooms of the exhibition. This structure contains living and non-living matter – and things in between. The climate inside is regulated with humidifiers. Additional blacklights add an atmosphere of lush growth. It is an embodiment of Lacuna Lab itself and a collaboration between all of its members.</p><p>FIREFLIES - Abe Pazos, Mei-Fang Liau</p><p>Fireflies is a collaborative spatial sound experience. The participants use their mobile devices to virtually approach others in the same room, communicating through generative visuals and abstract sounds. The harmony or dissonance of the sound guides the participants in their social exploration, making them aware of how connected or individual they are.</p><p>TYCHO - Thomas Heidtmann, Soma Holiday, Jemma Woolmore</p><p>Tycho is an interactive object that mimics the shape and behaviour of the James Webb Space Telescope by capturing light with a sensor and transmitting its colour via LEDs to a mirrored hexagonal surface, where it modulates a projection sequence inspired by images of the birth and death of stars.</p><p>TENDRIL RECURSION - Sarah Hermanutz, Mei-Fang Liau, Assi Pakkanen, Peter Kolski, Ramin Soleymani</p><p>Inspired by time, growth and decay, this atmospheric performance connects contemporary dance with a live-generated musical score and projected visuals. Wearing a costume embedded with textile sensors, the dancer acts as conductor of the generative graphics and musical variations. This performance explores the human interconnection with nature and technology.</p><p>IN ALVEO - Sé Sneaky, Joa Ritter, Yoko Iki, Sarah Hermanutz</p><p>In Alveo is an exploration of the connection between mother and baby during a natural birth.

Their specific topics of interest, methods, and perspectives are fundamentally different, yet they are united in their wish to reveal a hidden truth that is constituting our present.</p><p>Noor us Sabah Saeed from Pakistan takes us to Indus river, where she is looking into its current threats from climate change. Additionally, she investigates archaeological technologies to find out reasons for the disappearance of Sarasvati river and Harappan Civilization, in an effort to speculate further and retell the story of Indus differently. By investigating relations between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and human consumption patterns related to YouTube, Indian artist Pratyush Raman plays with the narrative of users engaging in consumption and becoming a part of the production, aiming to raise awareness and to reflect on it. As a relevant fragment in itself, both artistic positions refer to the greater and more complex context that constructs our past, present and future.</p><p>Curated by artist-curator Thomas Heidtmann and Lacuna Lab.</p><p> </p><h3>Pratyush Raman</h3><p>Pratyush is a practising artist from Bangalore, where his work revolves around education, technology and playfulness of mathematics. He teaches creative coding and new media at Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology. His enquiries deal with consciousness, conditioning and fiction in the contemporary paradigm of civilisation. In Serendipity Arts Festival, his installation work, Breathe Pong reconstructed Pong, one of the earliest arcade games, as an interactive reflection of breathing. He uses code, music and painting as his media of expression.</p><h3>Noor us Sabah Saeed</h3><p>Noor us Sabah (lives and works in Karachi, Pakistan) is a current resident artist for two months (Sep-Oct 2019) at Lacuna Lab, Berlin. Recently, she participated in two residencies: Kreative Pause Artist Residency in Karlsruhe, Germany and Murrree Museum Residency in Murrree, Pakistan. She is also a recipient of Lahore Biennale Foundation’s Research Grant 2018/19 and ifa (Institut für Auslandsbeziehungen) Künstlerkontakte grant 2019 for her project ‘How Much Time Does It Take for Fossils to Convert into Fuels?’. She has an MFA in Public Art and New Artistic Strategies from Bauhaus-University Weimar and a BFA from Visual Studies Department, University of Karachi.</p><p> </p><h4>Cooperation partners</h4><p>Lacuna Lab, Goethe-Institut Bangalore / Max Mueller Bhavan, Srishti Institute for Art, Design and Technology, Institut für Auslandsbeziehungen e.V.

Stay safe!</em></p><p>Nam June Paik is known for manipulating a TV set with a magnet. One might think that after we abandoned monitor tubes the combination of TV and magnetism is gone as well. But similar techniques are still possible today by manipulating the signal flow between our devices, like in between a laptop and a monitor.</p><p>The fact that most signals used to communicate between devices via wires are based on electric current and that allows for easy hacking. For example one can manipulate the VGA video signal with coils and magnetic fields. The signal being similar to sound signals makes for an easy transfer to sound and vice versa. One can make a video signal hearable and display an audio signal on a monitor.</p><p>In the workshop every participant will build a <a href=\"https://paperpcb.dernulleffekt.de/doku.php?id=vga_synthesizer:experimental_vga_processor\" target=\"_blank\">Experimental VGA Processor </a>that allows easy access to VGA signals and is able to mix all kind of signals.</p><p>With that we will process VGA and audio signals.
